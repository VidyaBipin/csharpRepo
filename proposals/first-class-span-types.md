# First-class Span Types

## Summary

We introduce first-class support for `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` in the language, including new implicit conversion types and consider them in more places,
allowing more natural programming with these integral types.

## Motivation

Since their introduction in C# 7.2, `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` have worked their way into the language and base class library (BCL) in many key ways. This is great for
developers, as their introduction improves performance without costing developer safety. However, the language has held these types at arm's length in a few key ways,
which makes it hard to express the intent of APIs and leads to a significant amount of surface area duplication for new APIs. For example, the BCL has added a number of new
[tensor primitive APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/94553) in .NET 9, but these APIs are all offered on `ReadOnlySpan<T>`. Because C# doesn't recognize the
relationship between `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, `Span<T>`, and `T[]`, it means that any developers looking to use those APIs with anything other than a `ReadOnlySpan<T>` have to explicitly
convert to a `ReadOnlySpan<T>`. Further, it also means that they don't have IDE tooling guiding them to use these APIs, since nothing will indicate to the IDE that it is valid
to pass them after conversion. There are also issues with generic inference in these scenarios. In order to provide maximum usability for this style of API, the BCL will have to
define an entire set of `Span<T>` and `T[]` overloads, which is a lot of duplicate surface area to maintain for no real gain. This proposal seeks to address the problem by
having the language more directly recognize these types and conversions.

## Detailed Design

The changes in this proposal will be tied to `LangVersion >= 13`.

### Implicit Span Conversions

We add a new type of implicit conversion to the list in [§10.2.1](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/conversions.md#1021-general), an
_implicit span conversion_. This conversion is a conversion from expression and is defined as follows:

------

An implicit span conversion permits `array_types`, `System.Span<T>`, `System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`, and `string` to be converted between each other as follows:
* From any single-dimensional `array_type` with element type `Ei` to `System.Span<Ei>`
* From any single-dimensional `array_type` with element type `Ei` to `System.ReadOnlySpan<Ui>`, provided that `Ei` is covariance-convertible ([§18.2.3.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/interfaces.md#18233-variance-conversion)) to `Ui`
* From `System.Span<Ti>` to `System.ReadOnlySpan<Ui>`, provided that `Ti` is covariance-convertible ([§18.2.3.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/interfaces.md#18233-variance-conversion)) to `Ui`
* From `System.ReadOnlySpan<Ti>` to `System.ReadOnlySpan<Ui>`, provided that `Ti` is covariance-convertible ([§18.2.3.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/interfaces.md#18233-variance-conversion)) to `Ui`
* From `string` to `System.ReadOnlySpan<char>`

------

We also add _implicit span conversion_ to the list of standard implicit conversions
([§10.4.2](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/conversions.md#1042-standard-implicit-conversions)). This allows overload resolution to consider
them when performing argument resolution, as in the previously-linked API proposal.

The explicit span conversions are the following:
- All *implicit span conversions*.
- From an *array_type* with element type `Ti` to `System.Span<Ui>` or `System.ReadOnlySpan<Ui>` provided an explicit reference conversion exists from `Ti` to `Ui`.

There is no standard explicit span conversion unlike other *standard explicit conversions* ([§10.4.3][standard-explicit-conversions])
which always exist given the opposite standard implicit conversion.

User-defined conversions are not considered when converting between
- any single-dimensional `array_type` and `System.Span<T>`/`System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`,
- any combination of `System.Span<T>`/`System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`,
- `string` and `System.ReadOnlySpan<char>`.

We also add _implicit span conversion_ to the list of acceptable implicit conversions on the first parameter of an extension method when determining applicability
([12.8.9.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/expressions.md#12893-extension-method-invocations)) (change in bold):

> An extension method `Cᵢ.Mₑ` is ***eligible*** if:
> 
> - `Cᵢ` is a non-generic, non-nested class
> - The name of `Mₑ` is *identifier*
> - `Mₑ` is accessible and applicable when applied to the arguments as a static method as shown above
> - An implicit identity, reference ~~or boxing~~ **, boxing, or span** conversion exists from *expr* to the type of the first parameter of `Mₑ`.

#### Variance

The goal of the variance section in _implicit span conversion_ is to replicate some amount of covariance for `System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`. Runtime changes would be required to fully
implement variance through generics here (see https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/ref-struct-interfaces.md for using `ref struct` types in generics), but we can
allow a limited amount of covariance through use of a proposed .NET 9 API: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96952. This will allow the language to treat `System.ReadOnlySpan<T>`
as if the `T` was declared as `out T` in some scenarios. We do not, however, plumb this variant conversion through _all_ variance scenarios, and do not add it to the definition of
variance-convertible in [§18.2.3.3](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v8/standard/interfaces.md#18233-variance-conversion). If in the future, we change the runtime
to more deeply understand the variance here, we can take the minor breaking change to fully recognize it in the language.

#### Patterns

Note that when `ref struct`s are used as a type in any pattern, only identity conversions are allowed:

```cs
class C<T> where T : allows ref struct
{
    void M1(T t) { if (t is T x) { } } // ok (T is T)
    void M2(R r) { if (r is R x) { } } // ok (R is R)
    void M3(T t) { if (t is R x) { } } // error (T is R)
    void M4(R r) { if (r is T x) { } } // error (R is T)
}
ref struct R { }
```

From the specification of *the is-type operator* ([§12.12.12.1][is-type-operator]):

> The result of the operation `E is T` [...] is a Boolean value indicating whether `E` is non-null and can successfully be converted to type `T`
> by a reference conversion, a boxing conversion, an unboxing conversion, a wrapping conversion, or an unwrapping conversion.
>
> [...]
>
> If `T` is a non-nullable value type, the result is `true` if `D` and `T` are the same type.

This behavior does not change with this feature, hence it will not be possible to write patterns for `Span`/`ReadOnlySpan`,
although similar patterns are possible for arrays (including variance):

```cs
using System;

M1<object[]>(["0"]); // prints
M1<string[]>(["1"]); // prints

void M1<T>(T t)
{
    if (t is object[] r) Console.WriteLine(r[0]); // ok
}

void M2<T>(T t) where T : allows ref struct
{
    if (t is ReadOnlySpan<object> r) Console.WriteLine(r[0]); // error
}
```

#### Code generation

The conversions will always exist, regardless of whether any runtime helpers used to implement them are present.
If the helpers are not present, attempting to use the conversion will result in a compile-time error that a compiler-required member is missing.

The compiler expects to use the following helpers or equivalents to implement the conversions:

| Conversion | Helpers |
|---|---|
| array to Span | `static implicit operator Span<T>(T[])` (defined in `Span<T>`) |
| array to ReadOnlySpan | `static implicit operator ReadOnlySpan<T>(T[])` (defined in `ReadOnlySpan<T>`) |
| Span to ReadOnlySpan | `static implicit operator ReadOnlySpan<T>(Span<T>)` (defined in `Span<T>`) and `static ReadOnlySpan<T>.CastUp<TDerived>(ReadOnlySpan<TDerived>)` |
| ReadOnlySpan to ReadOnlySpan | `static ReadOnlySpan<T>.CastUp<TDerived>(ReadOnlySpan<TDerived>)` |
| string to ReadOnlySpan | `static ReadOnlySpan<char> MemoryExtensions.AsSpan(string)` |

#### Overload resolution

*Better conversion from expression* ([§12.6.4.5][better-conversion-from-expression]) is updated to prefer implicit span conversions.
This is based on [collection expressions overload resolution changes][ce-or].

> Given an implicit conversion `C₁` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T₁`, and an implicit conversion `C₂` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T₂`, `C₁` is a *better conversion* than `C₂` if one of the following holds:
>
> - `E` is a *collection expression* and one of the following holds:
>   - `T₁` is `System.ReadOnlySpan<E₁>`, and `T₂` is `System.Span<E₂>`, and an implicit conversion exists from `E₁` to `E₂`.
>   - `T₁` is `System.ReadOnlySpan<E₁>` or `System.Span<E₁>`, and `T₂` is an *array_or_array_interface* with *element type* `E₂`, and an implicit conversion exists from `E₁` to `E₂`.
>   - `T₁` is not a *span_type*, and `T₂` is not a *span_type*, and an implicit conversion exists from `T₁` to `T₂`.
> - `E` is not a *collection expression* and one of the following holds:
>   - `E` exactly matches `T₁` and `E` does not exactly match `T₂`
>   - **`E` exactly matches neither of `T₁` and `T₂`,
>     and `C₁` is an implicit span conversion and `C₂` is not an implicit span conversion**
>   - `E` exactly matches both or neither of `T₁` and `T₂`,
>     **both or neither of `C₁` and `C₂` are an implicit span conversion**,
>     and `T₁` is a better conversion target than `T₂`
> - `E` is a method group, `T₁` is compatible with the single best method from the method group for conversion `C₁`, and `T₂` is not compatible with the single best method from the method group for conversion `C₂`

Without this rule, the following code that successfully compiled in C# 12 would result in an ambiguity error in C# 13
because of the new standard implicit conversion from array to ReadOnlySpan applicable to an extension method receiver:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

var a = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
a.M();

static class E
{
    public static void M(this IEnumerable<int> x) { }
    public static void M(this ReadOnlySpan<int> x) { }
}
```

The rule also allows introducing new APIs that would previously result in ambiguities, for example:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

C.M(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }); // would be ambiguous before

static class C
{
    public static void M(IEnumerable<int> x) { }
    public static void M(ReadOnlySpan<int> x) { } // can be added now
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Because the betterness rule is gated on `LangVersion >= 13`,
> API authors cannot add such new overloads if they want to keep supporting users on `LangVersion <= 12`.
> For example, if .NET 9 BCL introduced such overloads, users that upgrade to .NET 9 but stay on lower LangVersion
> would suddenly get ambiguity errors for existing code.

### Type inference

We update the type inferences section of the specification as follows (changes in **bold**).

> #### 12.6.3.9 Exact inferences
> 
> An *exact inference* *from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

> - Otherwise, sets `V₁...Vₑ` and `U₁...Uₑ` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:
>   - `V` is an array type `V₁[...]` and `U` is an array type `U₁[...]` of the same rank
>   - **`V` is a `Span<V₁>` and `U` is an array type `U₁[]` or a `Span<U₁>`**

### Breaking changes

As any proposal that changes conversions of existing scenarios, this proposal does introduce some new breaking changes. Here's a few examples:

#### User-defined conversions through inheritance

By adding _implicit span conversions_ to the list of standard implicit conversions, we can potentially change behavior when user-defined conversions are involved in a type hierarchy.
This example shows that change, in comparison to an integer scenario that already behaves as the new C# 13 behavior will.

```cs
Span<string> span = [];
var d = new Derived();
d.M(span); // Base today, Derived tomorrow
int i = 1;
d.M(i); // Derived today, demonstrates new behavior

class Base
{
    public void M(Span<string> s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base");
    }

    public void M(int i)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base");
    }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    public static implicit operator Derived(ReadOnlySpan<string> r) => new Derived();
    public static implicit operator Derived(long l) => new Derived();

    public void M(Derived s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived");
    }
}
```

#### Extension method lookup

By allowing _implicit span conversions_ in extension method lookup, we can potentially change what extension method is resolved by overload resolution.

```cs
namespace N1
{
    using N2;

    public class C
    {
        public static void M()
        {
            Span<string> span = new string[0];
            span.Test(); // Prints N2 today, N1 tomorrow
        }
    }

    public static class N1Ext
    {
        public static void Test(this ReadOnlySpan<string> span)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("N1");
        }
    }
}

namespace N2
{
    public static class N2Ext
    {
        public static void Test(this Span<string> span)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("N2");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Extension invocations as delegates

In the following code snippet, `Enumerable.Contains` was chosen previously,
but `MemoryExtensions.Contains` will be chosen with this feature
(thanks to the betterness rule, otherwise this would become an ambiguity).
However, it will result in this error:

```
error CS1113: Extension method 'MemoryExtensions.Contains<int>(Span<int>, int)' defined on value type 'Span<int>' cannot be used to create delegates
```

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

var a = new[] { 1, 2 };
var l = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
l.RemoveAll(a.Contains); // works today, error tomorrow
```

## Open questions

### Delegate signature matching (answered)

Should we allow variance conversion in delegate signature matching? For example:

```cs
using System;

Span<string> M1() => throw null!;
void M2(ReadOnlySpan<object> r) {}

delegate ReadOnlySpan<string> D1();
delegate void D2(ReadOnlySpan<string> r);

// Should these work?
D1 d1 = M1; // Convert Span<string>() to ReadOnlySpan<string>()
D2 d2 = M2; // Convert void(ReadOnlySpan<object>) to void(ReadOnlySpan<string>)

// These work today
string[] M3() => throw null!;
void M4(object[] a) {}

delegate object[] D3();
delegate void D4(string[] a);

D3 d3 = M3; // Convert string[]() to object[]()
D4 d4 = M4; // Convert void(object[]) to void(string[])
```

These conversions may not be possible to do without creating a wrapper lambda without runtime changes; the existing variant delegate conversions are possible to emit
without needing to create wrappers. We don't have precedent in the language for silent wrappers like this, and generally require users to create such wrapper lambdas themselves.

#### Answer

We will not allow variance in delegate conversions here. `D1 d1 = M1;` and `D2 d2 = M2;` will not compile. We could reconsider at a later point if use cases are discovered.
